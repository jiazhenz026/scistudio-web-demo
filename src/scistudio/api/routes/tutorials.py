"""Learning Center endpoints: the catalogue, the session, progress, and clearing.

ADR-053 Learning Center spec (``docs/specs/adr-053-learning-center.md``),
checklist §6.1.6. FR-003 removed the previous contents of this module — a single
``POST /api/tutorials/run-first-workflow/bootstrap`` that scaffolded one
hardcoded project — rather than keeping it as an alias, so that route now 404s.

This layer owns no tutorial behaviour. :class:`~scistudio.tutorials.session.TutorialRuntime`
decides what is listed, what is running, which step it is on, and when a step is
satisfied; everything here either renders one of its return values as JSON or
supplies one of the four ports it is constructed with. That split is what keeps
``api -> tutorials`` a one-way edge: the tutorial package may not import
``scistudio.api`` (checklist §6.1.2), so product state, the two API-layer event
names, project creation and deletion, and replay byte delivery all arrive from
here.

The four ports, and where each one's truth lives
------------------------------------------------

* :class:`_ApiProductState` satisfies :class:`~scistudio.tutorials.conditions.ProductState`.
  Every method is a pure read of something the product already knows (FR-046,
  FR-055) — the workflow definition, the three registries, the plot manifests,
  the lineage store, git, and the tutorial-scoped library. Three terms have no
  pre-existing store, so this module keeps one: see :class:`_RecordedSignals`.
* :data:`_EXTERNAL_EVENTS` carries the two FR-050 event names declared under
  ``scistudio.api``, as the constants rather than as literals (checklist §6.1.5).
* :class:`_RuntimeProvisioner` creates the tutorial project through
  ``ApiRuntime.create_project`` so it lands in the known-projects registry with
  its marker (FR-063, FR-064), and deletes it with ``_rmtree_force``.
* :func:`~scistudio.api.routes.ai_pty.replay.open_replay_tab` supplies the
  scripted byte source, delivered through the product's real PTY path (FR-061a).

Re-evaluation is event-driven, never polled (FR-051). The runtime subscribes to
exactly the event types it maps and re-judges the active step when one arrives,
which advances and persists the session; the frontend sees the result on its
next read of ``/sessions/active``.
