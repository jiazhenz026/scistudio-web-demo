"""Scan / registration helpers for :class:`BlockRegistry`.

Per ADR-047 §C9: this module hosts only module-level private helpers — it
must contain **zero** ``class`` definitions. The :class:`BlockRegistry`
class lives in ``__init__.py``.

Owns:

- ``_scan_builtins`` — register the four core blocks (LoadData, SaveData,
  AIBlock, SubWorkflowBlock).
- ``_scan_tier1`` — discover blocks from ``.py`` files under configured
  scan directories.
- ``_reject_shadowing_type_files`` — ADR-053 FR-016 / §13 OQ-1 reporting
  adapter over ``scistudio.core.dropins.guard_dropin_type_roots``, which owns
  the rule and the mitigation for every process.
- ``_scan_tier2`` — discover blocks via ``scistudio.blocks`` entry points
  (ADR-025 callable protocol).
- ``_scan_package_src_dirs`` — Tier 3 scan of hard-installed/bundled
  ``packages/*/src`` source packages (desktop runtime).
- ``_register_spec`` — apply per-spec validation and write into the
  registry's ``_registry`` + ``_aliases`` dicts.
- ``_validate_capability_registration`` — ADR-043 capability-id and
  default-conflict cross-spec validation.

    discovery (:func:`_scan_tier2`) depends on installed ``*.dist-info``
    metadata, which the desktop bundle does not carry — it ships core as raw

    process/code/app palette vanish in packaged builds, leaving only the
    handful already hard-registered here. Direct registration is
    environment-independent (source checkout, editable install, bundled
    source, or frozen), so the ``scistudio.blocks`` entry-point group is now
    reserved for third-party plugin packages only.

    (``Split``) are intentionally excluded from the palette. The interactive
    :class:`DataRouter` supersedes the former collection filter/slice/split

    Security boundary (issue #1531): drop-in files are executed as Python
    modules in the server process.  Only files from trusted project- or
    user-controlled directories should be registered via
    :meth:`BlockRegistry.add_scan_dir`.

    **What the try/except below does and does not isolate.** It catches
    ``BaseException``, not ``Exception``, so a drop-in that raises
    ``SystemExit`` is recorded as a failure and skipped like any other. That is
    not an exotic case: a script converted into a block keeps its
    ``sys.exit(main())`` idiom or its ``argparse`` error path, and under the
    narrower ``except Exception`` such a file killed the palette refresh on
    every startup, recorded no ``DropinFailure`` — so FR-015's "silent
    disappearance ends" was not met for that class — and left the user no
    in-product way to find the file, because the palette they would have used
    to find it is what died
    (``docs/audit/2026-08-07-adr-053-spec1-write-path.md`` P2-1).
    ``KeyboardInterrupt`` is re-raised: it is the operator's own signal, and
    swallowing it would make the server un-interruptible during a scan.

    Two failure modes remain outside this boundary and cannot be brought inside
    it in-process: ``os._exit()``, which no handler can intercept, and a module
    that never returns from import, which needs a wall clock this process does
    not control. Both belong to the out-of-process sandbox the ``TODO(#1531)``
    below defers — a thread-based bound would change where every well-behaved
    drop-in executes, and an asynchronous interrupt would land in whichever
    thread happens to be the main one. This paragraph states the boundary
    rather than claiming isolation the code does not provide.

    ADR-053 FR-012/FR-014: the drop-in type directories of the same tiers join
    ``sys.path`` for the duration of drop-in execution, project tier first, so
    ``from spectrum import SpectrumData`` resolves ``<project>/types/spectrum.py``
    and a project type shadows a user-library type of the same file name. Which
    directories those are is decided by :mod:`scistudio.core.dropins`, not here.
    FR-013: the same roots are stamped on every Tier-1 spec so the worker
    subprocess reconstructs the block against an identical import path.

    FR-015: every refusal — a module that raised on import, and every FR-016
    type-name collision — is recorded on the registry and returned by
    ``GET /api/blocks/``, so a drop-in block no longer disappears in silence.

    TODO(#1531): a full subprocess-sandbox for drop-in execution is deferred.
