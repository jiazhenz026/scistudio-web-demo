"""Four-source tutorial discovery, and the catalogue the Learning Center lists.

ADR-053 Learning Center spec, FR-016 … FR-024 and FR-029a
(``docs/specs/adr-053-learning-center.md``).

Four sources, and no fifth (FR-016): a directory inside the core distribution,
packages through the ``scistudio.tutorials`` entry-point group, the user
directory ``~/.scistudio/tutorials``, and the open project's ``tutorials/``.
The two local tiers are resolved through
:func:`scistudio.core.dropins.tutorial_scan_dirs`, which is the same tier
definition blocks and types use, so package install, package uninstall, branch
switch, and the working-tree rewrites that refresh the registries reach the
tutorial catalogue by the path they already travel rather than a fourth one
(FR-031).

**Listing imports nothing (FR-018).** Titles, summaries, covers, order, and
requirements come from manifests alone. A package tutorial's directory is
resolved from distribution metadata by
:func:`scistudio.core.entry_points.resolve_entry_point_directory`, which never
calls ``EntryPoint.load()``, ``importlib.import_module``, or
``importlib.util.find_spec``. This module contains no other way to reach a
package's files. The guarantee is asserted with a ``sys.meta_path`` hook in
``tests/tutorials/test_discovery_no_import.py`` rather than by reading the
source, because the failure it guards against is a refactor reintroducing an
import, not a particular spelling.

**Nothing that goes wrong empties a group (FR-022).** Every manifest is read
inside its own attempt. A file that fails schema validation, a file written for
a newer core, a directory whose id collides with a sibling's, and a package
whose entry point cannot be resolved each cost exactly their own entry. The
three failures owe the user *different* sentences, which is why they are three
paths rather than one ``except``:

* a malformed manifest raises :class:`ManifestValidationError` and is listed
  with its validation message — this tutorial is broken;
* a manifest declaring a ``manifest_version`` this core does not read raises
  :class:`UnsupportedManifestVersionError` and is listed naming the version it
  needs (FR-007a) — this tutorial needs a newer SciStudio;
* an unmet ``requires`` is not a failure at all: the tutorial is listed, marked
  unavailable, and says which requirement is unmet (FR-024), because a user
  cannot decide whether to install a package whose teaching material is
  invisible until after installing it.

**Identity is the pair (source, id) (FR-019).** Two packages may both ship
``intro``. Two tutorials in *one* source may not: a duplicate id makes
:class:`~scistudio.tutorials.projects.TutorialKey` ambiguous, so both entries
are listed as unavailable naming both directories (FR-023) rather than one of
them silently winning.

This module may not import :mod:`scistudio.tutorials.session` or
``scistudio.api`` (checklist §6.1.2). Everything it cannot read for itself —
the installed distribution set, whether an agent provider is available, whether
git is available — goes through :class:`DiscoveryEnvironment`, which may be
handed the answers or probe for them lazily on first use. Lazily, because none
of the three is free and a tutorial that declares no ``requires`` asks none of
them: listing a catalogue of such tutorials costs a directory walk and nothing
else.
